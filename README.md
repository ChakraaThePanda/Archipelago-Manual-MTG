 Files required to run the Manual Archipelago for MTG Tournament

## Unflexibility
Currently this apworld is pretty set in stone in the utility I have for it at this time, meaning that if I were to create a different number of brackets / games, I'd have to modify it in the source code of the APWorld.

So unless you know what you are doing with it, this is pretty unusable outside of the scope I'm using it for.
